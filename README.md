# ECS
A simple Entity Component System

This ECS is in no way attempting to be the most performant ECS there is available. It's just been a fun exercise to make my own and understand where the pitfalls in performance are. If you're looking for a performant ECS packed full of features then please check out things like [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt).

I've made a video series on writing this ECS as part of a larger game engine series. If you're interested you can check out the "Let's write an ECS" playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMClevbUJi9DsmIuij4RzjJ_kUyrQufEs

I'm also lacking in documentation and code quality, again this was purely a fun exercise and not meant for showcasing the best ECS.

# Build
To build you'll need to update the submodules. You should the be able to just use regular CMake calls after that.
